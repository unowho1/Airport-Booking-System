The C code implements a basic airport booking system using arrays, queues, and linked lists. It tracks seat availability in business and economy classes through arrays, while a queue handles the waiting list when classes are full. Each passengerâ€™s details, like name, age, class, and food preference, are stored in a queue structure. A linked list records booked passengers with functions for adding new entries. Simple checks are performed to handle seat limits and waiting list assignments effectively.
